# CapstoneProject-Pong-

## 1.0 Project Management Documentation

### 1.1 Project Aims
* The first aim of my capstone project is to re-create a working up to date version of the first video game called Pong
  
* I also want to make the game still appeal to the people that used to play it back in the day. I don’t want to make the game too   futuristic that people dislike it
  
* Another aim is to implement the use of controllers to make the game unique to me and it then adds on to the game as some people prefer to use controller
  
* I want to produce a quality up to date piece of work that the users will like and want to play.  

* Possibly the most important aim of that the game will be completed by 28th March

* I also want to always be improving my own skills in programming so thats why I am adding in the controller idea to further challenge my skills

### 1.2 System Requirements
**Power Point** – I will be using power point to show off my game on the 23rd February and on the 28th March. Both of these dates we will be presenting the work that we have complete up to these dates. Power Point is the best program to use for this and I have the most experience in it than any other presenting programs.

**Unity** – I will use Unity to code my game as it supports the game that I want to create and it supports PC games so all I have to do is export it at the end. It also allows controllers to be attached to its games so that is a big help with my game it also has some helpful pointers if you get stuck. I also have past experience using Unity in other Projects

**Internet Access** - Another thing that I will be using is the internet to collect research mainly but also I will be saving work and doing documentation on GitHub so I will need the internet to access the work  

**Xbox Controllers** – I will be needing Xbox controllers as I will be implementing them into the game so you can control your character with either keyboard, Mouse or controller. 
Computer – I will also need a computer with good specs so that I am able to create the game and test it as much as I want without working about filling up the hard drives or crashing the PC

### 1.4 Cost
* Firstly I will be creating my Game on my PC at college and at home the PC at college does not cost me to use but at home I recently purchased a new PC which cost me around £1500. The reason I built the PC was so I can run all of our programs easily and also be able to run many tests and im big into video games.

* Secondly I will be using Unity which is not a free software it is $125 a month and the project is scheduled for 3 months so that a total of $375 which I will have to pay to be able to program the game. 

* Thirdly the little things that add up but are important to the project is. My travel back and forth to college costing me money in petrol and parking come to about £60 - £80 a month. Also internet bills at home which are essential for me to have internet which is about £40 a month.
Overall this whole project will cost about £650 not including the PC that I recently built 

### 1.5 Scope 
I want to keep all of the scoring and rules the same as the original game. I also want to keep the style and theme the same as that is what made Pong so good the basics of it all you had to look at was the ball going back and forth. 

I will be adding in new update characters and also new balls. I am also going to add so you can change the background. The score system will be the same but maybe more celebratory things will happen when someone wins/scores. But the main jest of the game will stay the same with certain add-ons like the ones above and use of controller
